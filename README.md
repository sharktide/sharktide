<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Rihaan 👋</h1>

I'm a student, developer, and lifelong tinkerer with a passion for building things that make tech more intuitive and impactful. I spend most of my time writing in **Python**, **JavaScript**, **C#**, and **C++** and I dive deep into **AI**, particularly computer vision and image classification.
